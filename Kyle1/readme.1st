Hi Kyle

thanks for the feedback on the API

1. setting with and height is easy if you know how. 
- please see the implementaiton of the setWidthContraint method

2. There is one bug there stops you from setting the scrollbar via code. We will fix this shortly
- in the meantime, i just added a grid through the editor and made it scrollable horizontally

Best
Your SCADE team
