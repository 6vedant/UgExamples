Hi Kyle

thanks for the feedback on the API

1. setting width and height is easy if you know how. 
- please see the implementation of the setWidthContraint method

2. There is one bug that stops you from setting the scrollbar via code. We will fix this shortly in the next days
- in the meantime, i just added a grid through the editor and made it scrollable horizontally

Best
Your SCADE team
